### Go Maths

A generic vector maths package supporting various standard math operations on vectors of degree-n and scalars.

The algorithm implementations are entirely type-agnostic following the Go generics pattern. Separate type-specializations are implemened using simple extensions. Exemplary type-specializations for float32 and big.Float valued vectors are provided.

Part of the Go Generics proof-of-concept packages:
